Welcome to my blog! This is where I plan to dump my musings on recent LLM hype, my unfiltered notes on recent papers, and updates on what I'm up to. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terry-m3/) and let me know your thoughts and opinions on the topics!

What's going to be here?
======

This blog will consist of a number of things, but mainly:
* Notes on papers/concepts
* Musings on current events in AI/ML/DS

As an example, I am currently reading papers on *mixture-of-experts (MoE)* architectures as well as *pruning, quantization, and QLoRA* techniques, so stay tuned for potentially some of my notes on those!
