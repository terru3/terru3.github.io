title: "Machine Unlearning"
excerpt: "Implemented common machine unlearning (MU) algorithms such as zero-glance and zero-shot unlearning via error-maximizing noise and gated knowledge transfer respectively, selective synaptic dampening (SSD), incompetent teacher unlearning, etc., exploring the nascent field of MU and its applications in the right to be forgotten, debiasing, influence functions and model interpretability, and more."
