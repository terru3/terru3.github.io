Hello! My name is Terry Ming and I am a senior applied math, statistics and data science undergraduate at UCLA. My research interests include deep learning (in particular NLP and scaling), ML fairness, explainability, machine unlearning, conformal prediction, generative models, graph networks, interdisciplinary data science and applications like climate analysis, etc.

I'm also working on some exciting data and ML projects. Feel free to read what I've been up to or contact me for more details / project pitches!

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities beginning Summer 2024.
