Hello! I am a data scientist at Cashmere and recent UCLA math/stats grad. My ML research interests include deep learning, interpretability, machine unlearning, conformal prediction, and more, and I'm all about applying interdisciplinary approaches to both solve exciting, difficult problems and optimize aspects of our everyday lives.

I'm also working on some exciting data and ML projects on the side. Feel free to read what I've been up to or contact me for more details / project pitches!
